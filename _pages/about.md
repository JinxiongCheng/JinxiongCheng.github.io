<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Bioengineering](https://engineering.pitt.edu/departments/bioengineering/) of the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/),  and a member of [Chen Lab](https://www.ycchenlab.org/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yu-Chih Chen](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/people/faculty/yu-chih-chen/) at [Hillman Cancer Center](https://hillman.upmc.com/).
In terms of my undergraduate study, I was at the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.sustech.edu.cn/en/) , [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/) (ÂçóÊñπÁßëÊäÄÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÁîüÁâ©ÂåªÂ≠¶Â∑•Á®ãÁ≥ª), advised by [Prof. Xingyu Jiang (ËíãÂÖ¥ÂÆá)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/jiangxingyu.html).

During my senior year, I joined [Prof. Aaron Wheeler](https://bme.utoronto.ca/faculty-research/core-faculty/aaron-wheeler/)‚Äôs Lab at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), and finished my undergraduate thesis about [digital microfluidics](https://microfluidics.utoronto.ca/). 

My research interest includes microfluidics, nanotechnology, single-cell analysis and oncology.
